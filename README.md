# qRAM Library for Q#

This library implements a variety of different proposals for memory for quantum computers, also commonly called qRAM.

## Contents
The proposals for qRAM fall into two main catagories, implicit memory and explicit memory.
Currently planned proposals that will be implemented in this library include:

### Implicit Memory
- Bucket Brigade
    - [Original Proposal](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03450)
    - Improvements
    - etc.

### Explicit Memory
-
